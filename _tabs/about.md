<h1 align="center">Hey👋, I'm Atharva Mahamuni</h1>
<h3 align="center">Hobbyist Software Developer . Nerdy Technophile . Hardcore Generalist</h3>

<br>

<p align="left">I am the first principle thinker, tinkerer/hacker, and generalist. I like to build stuff for its own sake and improve them to make them more meaningful. I have been interested in technology and businesses since childhood.</p>

<p>I wrote my first line of code in 2017 and started to like the idea of building something from nothing. Since then I worked on various projects, and scrappy garbage code that works (feel free to improve and make a pull request)😁.</p>

<p>I am a generalist computer programmer; who likes to experiment with different tech stacks. I have played with many tech stacks and programming languages, visit my github profile to know more.</p>
